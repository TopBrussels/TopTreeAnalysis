*** chain.C
-------
chain.C is the analysis chain all over again, runs the selection over the result
of SingleToptW outputs and produces all the histos for plots and tables
it is very dumb to run it, typically I run everything together in a 
.csh with this structure:

root.exe -b -l -q chain.C\(0\,0\,0\)
etc


*** plotmaker.C
-------
does the basic plots over the results of chain.C

root.exe plotmaker.C works directly, then you only have to feed it with 
1 -> mumu or 2 -> ee


*** tables.C
-------
does the tables over the results of chain.C
runs identically as dumb as plotmaker.C


*** control.C 
-------
does the control region estimation, it is like chain.C plus an extra guy
something like this:

root.exe -b -l -q control.C\(0\,0\,0\,1\)

*** controlplots.C
-------
does the control region plots
identical to plotmaker
